## Summary

I'm an experienced software developer, a back-end generalist, specializing in Python.

I really care about programming. For you, this means that I create products that work, that are well
tested, delivered to a predictable schedule, and costing less money to maintain and extend in the
future.

I also really care about people and teams, which means I believe in continuous mentoring, radically
jovial relationships, real talk, and taking pride in our raised expectations of what we become
capable of as a group. Great teams enable the creation of great individuals, not the other way
around.

## Experience and technologies

I have many years experience in **Python** (and other languages prior to that). I created
[Colorama](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/colorama), a personal **open source** project that has
become the world's [28th most popular](https://hugovk.github.io/top-pypi-packages/#colorama) Python
library. I present at international conferences like PyCon, and am a Fellow of the Python Software
Foundation.

I often produce **web APIs**, leaning on [HATEOAS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HATEOAS) using
**Django**, **FastAPI**, or **Flask**, often interfacing with Relational storage such as
**PostgreSQL**, Oracle or MySQL, or NoSQL such as Rethink or MongoDB, indexed using ElasticSearch.

I love working with **Linux**, such as sending hypervisor commands to manage **virtual
machines** or **network configuration**, as part of building **public or private clouds**.

I consult and mentor in **Test-Driven Development (TDD)**, and regard projects which use this, and
other **Agile** and **eXtreme Programming** techniques, as my favorites of the places I've
worked. I was tech reviewer on O'Reilly's [Test Driven Development with
Python](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/test-driven-development-with/9781491958698), published
on testing [in Python
Magazine](https://www.tartley.com/posts/acceptance-testing-net-applications-using-ironpython), and
landed modest CPython patches [in
unittest](https://github.com/python/cpython/commit/1341bb0019868345bab8adff94263c81e1d66eae).

I make continual open source contributions, e.g. this recent drive-by [analysis and
fixes](https://github.com/getnikola/nikola/issues/3671) for static web site generator Nikola, or
[this page of ModernGL docs](https://moderngl.readthedocs.io/en/latest/topics/buffer_format.html),
which I created from scratch to help me understand a fiddly API concept, using plain language but
without skirting details.

## Current Role

------------------ ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------
**Lambda**\        Lambda is a public cloud providing access to cutting-edge GPUs, which customers
*1 year,*\         use to train AI models. My role on the *Primitives* team is to convert customer
*to present.*      requests and other events into QEMU and libvirt configuration across
                   multiple datacenters, to create and manage virtual machines, network
                   configuration, access to GPU hardware and storage, presenting the results to
                   users as their own private cluster with the requested capabilities.

## Previous Roles

------------------ ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------
**Canonical**\     The [*Snap Store*](https://snapcraft.io/store) is an app
*4 years*\         store for Linux applications. I worked on the backend Python web APIs, which
                   serve 5k req/s, installing apps & securely updating hundreds of
                   millions of Linux devices. I lead the effort to consolidate code from the
                   company's other types of binary downloadable artifacts to all be handled by the
                   Snap Store, turning it into a single "binary artifact store", which allowed us to
                   decommission other teams’ services as their functionality was subsumed, and
                   converge behaviors such as publishing, versioned updates, risk tracks, etc, to be
                   more consistent across types of downloadable artifact, all while honoring
                   high-traffic SLAs & preserving compatibility with public APIs used by the diverse
                   clients of each artifact type.

**IBM Cloud**\     Implemented IBM Cloud's
*2 years*           [*security groups*](https://www.tartley.com/posts/illustrating-uses-of-ibm-cloud-security-groups/)
                   feature, in Python & GoLang, converting user requests into iptables
                   config across many instances, to provide dynamic on-instance firewalling.
                   I also produced & presented training courses across the division, teaching
                   hundreds of developers how to contribute *good* tests to the massive IBM Cloud
                   Python test suite, dramatically reducing time spent on creating and maintaining
                   tests, while making the tests themselves faster, more thorough, and more
                   reliable.

**Able.ag,**\      Often as a tech lead, such as at **Able.ag**, where I relieved the company's
**Antidote.me,**\  technical founder of architectural, design, and mentoring responsibilities.
**BATS Trading,**\ Usually these roles created web APIs in Python, ingesting, transforming and
**Rangespan**\     indexing large amounts of data. At ecommerce startup *Rangespan*, we integrated
*Contracts,*\      with hundreds of suppliers to ingest data for 100 million product lines, and then
*6 years.*         routed over a billion sales from participating retailers to dynamically selected
                   suppliers.

**Made.com**\      This furniture retailer's backend Enterprise Resource Planning team was
*14 month*\        dysfunctional, moribund from years of technical debt. I mentored the team, hired
*contract.*        new members, replaced the existing week-long manual deployment process with
                   modern CI. Together we radically fixed and improved the legacy systems, allowing
                   the team to start delivering new business-critical features to production on
                   a predictable schedule.

**Resolver**\      Hardcore eXtreme Programming startup, doing pairing and TDD, producing web and
**Systems**\       desktop software in Python and .Net IronPython, for
*5 years.*         financial & scientific clients. At one point I helped re-
                   implement all of Excel's statistical functions, with improved numerical accuracy.

**GIS**\           I single-handedly designed and
**consulting**\    coded *Habitat Capture*, a desktop GIS tool in .Net using
*3 years.*         ArcObjects. End users described it as "*about a billion times better*" than their
                   last commissioned tool. The resulting dataset won that year's British
                   Cartographic Society award.

                   For **Ordinance Survey** and **ESRI UK** I designed spatial SQL queries to run
                   against the UK's definitive multi-terabyte geographic dataset, as a
                   proof-of-concept to derive new sellable data products.
