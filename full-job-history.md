# Job History

Job history excised from my c.v, for reference.

Lambda
: *1 year to present.* Remote.
A public cloud providing access to cutting-edge GPUs, used by clients to train
AI models and run inference. My team provided 

Canonical
: *4 years to 2023.* Remote.
I work on the backend of the [*Snap Store*](https://snapcraft.io/store), an app
store for Linux applications, creating Python web APIs to serve 5k req/s,
installing and securely updating applications for hundreds of millions of
Ubuntu & other Linux devices. I recently lead a project to migrate data and
consolidate logic for the company's other types of binary downloadable (e.g.
container images, "[charms](https://juju.is/about)", etc.) into the existing
snap store services, allowing us to decommission other teams’ services as their
functionality was subsumed, and converge behaviors such as publishing,
versioned updates, risk tracks, etc, to be more consistent across types of
downloadable artifact, all while honoring high-traffic SLAs & preserving
compatibility of public APIs used by the diverse clients of each artifact type.

IBM
: *2 years to 2019.* Rochester, MN, USA.
Implemented
[IBM Cloud's security groups feature](https://www.tartley.com/posts/illustrating-uses-of-ibm-cloud-security-groups/),
in Python & Go, converting user security group actions into iptables
configuration across many instances, to provide dynamic on-instance
firewalling. I also produced & presented training courses for the inexperienced
team, (e.g. had never written Go before) which were later requested across the
division, especially around Cloud's massive Python test suite, bringing
hundreds of developers up to speed on how to contribute good tests,
dramatically reducing time spent on creating and maintaining tests, while
making the tests themselves faster and more reliable.

Able.Ag
: *4 months to June 2017.* Rochester, MN, USA.\
A five early person startup that stood out due to looking like being already
profitable without external investment. I worked on new Python web APIs, and
relieved the founder of technical design and mentoring responsibilities. The
finances didn't pan out in the end, but the founder remains one of my best
friends.

Antidote.me (aka Trialreach)
: *18 months to February 2017.* London, UK.\
Connecting medical trials with eligible volunteers. I created hypermedia JSON
APIs using Python micro-services, implemented with Falcon, a lightweight and
blazing fast WSGI framework. Large data ingestion and processing using a
mixture of RethinkDB, MongoDB and PostgreSQL, indexed using Elasticsearch, and
deployed to AWS. A timeless classic.

Made.com
: *14 months to April 2015.* London, UK.\
Made was a furniture retailer struggling to model their disruptive logistics
model in customized Enterprise Resource Planning software. I took over a
dysfunctional team, moribund from years of technical debt, e.g. nobody could
remember when they had last performed the multi-week manual process to release
to production. I mentored the existing team, hired more developers, created a
one-minute automated CI and deployment pipeline, instituted thorough testing
and pre-merge reviews, and together we redesigned and reimplemented their
system. This transformed operational reliability, and allowed the team to start
delivering new business-critical features to production on a predictable
schedule.

BATS Global Trading
: *8 months to February 2014.* London, UK.\
Worked on a five person team at this financial exchange to manage the hundreds
of overnight Python batch I/O tasks required to audit and report on the day's
executed trades, representing a sum of money in excess of $50 trillion, daily.
This involves lots of PostgreSQL, some Django, and the reading and writing of a
variety of data formats, from JSON over HTTP to Excel spreadsheets.

Rangespan
: *2 years to 2013.* London, UK.\
First technical hire at this innovative e-commerce startup, founded by former
Amazon executives. We integrated with hundreds of product suppliers, to
produce a feed of millions of available retail products. Retailers such as
department stores integrated curated subsets of this feed into their existing
websites, via which over a billion items were sold. The item lifecycle state
machine I owned forwarded these sales to a supplier selected at runtime using
criteria such as current availability, price, and ability to ship in
retailer-branded packaging.

Resolver Systems
: *5 years to 2011.* London, UK.\
Hardcore eXtreme Programming startup, producing web and desktop software in
Python and .Net IronPython for financial & scientific clients. We paired on all
code, using extremely thorough TDD, becoming regular conference speakers on the
topics. This was a transformative experience for all of us, which heavily
influences the way I code to this day. At one point I re-implemented all of
Excel's statistical functions with improved numerical accuracy. Left because,
despite the technical excellence of the team, we were failing to find
product-market fit.

Atos Origin
: *3 month contract in 2006*. London, UK.\
Enterprisey GIS web client for
[DEFRA](https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/department-for-environment-food-rural-affairs).
Amazing, I'd almost forgotten that I actually worked here - in my mind it has
been pigeonholed as the place where TheSuze worked, along with all my old
Denver GDS friends and colleagues.

Peter Brett Associates
: *2 month contract in 2006*. Remote, UK.\
Habitat Capture v2. It was only during this contract that I understood that PBA
were selling the software I'd single-handedly written, not just to Kent County
Council, but also to local authorities all across Europe, and that my hourly
rate was too low.

London Borough of Hammersmith & Fulham
: *3 month contract in 2006.* London, UK.\
Custom ArcMap desktop functionality coded in C#. Ended on an unexpectedly sour
note after I delivered and demoed the software by the end of my contract. A
week later a manager phoned me rudely because it now wasn't working for them.
Normally I would have happily helped to troubleshoot, but was dissuaded from it
by being shouted at.

ESRI UK
: *5 month contract in 2006.* Cambridge, UK.\
Develop tools like an ArcMap importer from AutoCAD in C#, using spatial
operations to correctly handle nested geometries to create holes and islands.

Ordnance Survey
: *4 month contract in 2005*. Southampton, UK.\
Proof-of-concept SQL processing of MasterMap, the UK's definitive national
geospatial dataset, writing spatial SQL queries (e.g. use spatial heuristics to
infer relationships between address points and land parcels) over terabyte
datasets, then optimize them to run in hours instead of weeks. My PoC was
subsequently productized and made part of MasterMap, the OS' flagship data
product.

London Borough of Lambeth
: *4 month contract in 2004.* London, UK.\
A second stint, including C# development of ArcMap desktop 'pan to next' tool.

Kent County Council
: *7 month contract in 2004*. Maidstone, UK.\
For Peter Brett Associates I single-handedly designed and coded Habitat
Capture, a desktop GIS tool, in VB.Net at their request, using ArcObjects for
ArcMap. End users described it as “*about a billion times better*” than their
last commissioned tool. The resulting dataset won that year's British
Cartographic Society award. 

London Borough of Lambeth
: *9 month contract in 2003*. London, UK.\
Design and create geodatabases for the borough. Write and deliver user
training.

Schlumberger-Sema, aka Convergent Group
: *5 years, from 1998*. Denver, CO, USA.\
Software developer and GIS consultant on several GIS projects, such as the
migration of 250 City of Portland users from disparate CAD systems to a single
ESRI-based platform for city-wide sharing of geospatial data -- a project that
was subsequently used as a best-practice case study by ESRI.

Andersen Consulting
: *3 month contract, extended to 15 months. 1997*. Newcastle, UK.\
C++ on UNIX for a 250-developer project to replace the UK's social security
infrastructure. Soon drafted onto the project-wide high intensity ‘SWAT’
troubleshooting team.

NetXtra
: *18 months in 1996*. Suffolk, UK.\
Co-founded a start-up, creating websites, web consulting, and three of us
integrated with hundreds of individual hotels to provide bookings over the
internet. Built the company to profitability from scratch, with zero capital or
external investment, into a business which still exists today, employing over
fifty people.

Graphic Data Systems (GDS)
: *2 years, 1995*. Cambridge, UK and Melbourne, Australia.\
GIS product development in C++, specializing in map projections, spatial
transformations, geometric operations, 2D / 3D rendering and image data
formats.

Marconi Research Centre
: *5 years, 1990*. Chelmsford, UK\
Research Scientist developing DSP algorithms in C++ to analyse radar echoes of
non-co-operative aircraft. I have much fondness for the company that sponsored
me through university, providing an annual stipend of a few thousand pounds,
plus incredible paid work experience over summer vacations in various wacky
military research labs.
