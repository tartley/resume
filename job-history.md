# Job History

Job history excised from my c.v, for reference.

Canonical
:   *4 years to 2023.*

IBM
:   *2 years to 2019.*

Able.Ag
:   *4 months to June 2017.*

Antidote.me (aka Trialreach)
:   *18 months to February 2017.*\
Creating hypermedia JSON APIs using Python micro-services, implemented with Falcon, a lightweight
and blazing fast WSGI framework. Large data ingestion and processing using a mixture of RethinkDB,
MongoDB and PostgreSQL, indexed using ElasticSearch, and deployed to AWS.

Made.com
:   *14 months to April 2015.*\
Made was a furniture retailer struggling to model their disruptive logistics
model in customized Enterprise Resource Planning software. I took over a
dysfunc- tional team, moribund from years of technical debt, e.g. nobody could
remem- ber when they had last performed the multi-week manual process to
release to production. I mentored the existing team, hired more developers,
created a one- minute automated CI and deployment pipeline, instituted thorough
testing and pre- merge reviews, and together we redesigned and reimplemented
their system. This transformed operational reliability, and allowed the team to
start delivering new business-critical features to production on a predictable
schedule.

BATS Global Trading
:   *8 months to February 2014.*\
Working on a five person team at this financial exchange to manage the hundreds
of overnight Python batch I/O tasks required to audit and report on the day's
executed trades, representing a sum of money in excess of $50 trillion, daily.
This involves lots of PostgreSQL, some Django, and the reading and writing of a
variety of data formats, from JSON over HTTP to Excel spreadsheets.

Rangespan
:   *2 years to 2013.*
First technical hire at this innovative e-commerce startup, founded by former
Amazon executives. We integrated with hundreds of product suppliers, to
produce a curated feed of millions of available retail products.
