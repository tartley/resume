## Purpose

See http://rockportinstitute.com/resumes/

My résumé has one purpose only: to win an interview. It does so by making the
same assertion as a good advertisement:

> If you buy this product, you will get these specific benefits.

It must make this assertion clearly and boldly within 10 seconds. To be
effective, you must focus on the employer's needs, not yours. What does the
person doing the hiring deperately want?

* Productive
* Take ownership of nailing down requirements, architecture and design.
* Smart and flexible enough to tackle any task that needs doing
* Create cohesive teams
* Minimal designs, clean code that is easy for others to understand and modify,
  and flexible to future needs.
* Experise to make automated tests easy to write, fast to run, and high in
  value, so that you can deploy with confidence.
* Simple monitoring techniques to ensure your development team know about
  failures before your users do.
