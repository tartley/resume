Summary
-------

I'm an experienced back-end software engineer, specialising in Python, but with
many other technologies under my belt and eager to learn more.

I do whatever it takes to get software development projects to succeed.

I'm highly productive, delivering working code and shippable features on or
ahead of schedule, and am smart and flexible enough to tackle any task that
needs to get done.

I take ownership of requirements and architectures, delivering and then
refining minimal products to make consistent progress even when the way ahead
seems unclear.

I forge great team spirit, raising morale by building strong relationships,
fostering mutual mentorship, and taking pride in our raised expectations of
what we are capable of.

My code is clean and my designs are simple, with the goal of sustaining our
team's velocity in the months and years ahead by making things easy to
understand, maintain and modify.

In my free time, I've contributed patches to the CPython standard library
(unittest), created the world's 23rd most popular Python library (`Colorama`_,
500,000 downloads per month), presented at international conferences
(predominantly PyCon), and been voted a Fellow of the Python Software
Foundation.

Professional Experience
-----------------------

**Antidote.me** (formerly TrialReach), `London, UK`, (Apr 2015 to present)

Creating hypermedia **JSON APIs** using **Python**
micro-services, implemented with **Falcon**, a lightweight and blazing fast
WSGI framework. Large data ingestion and processing using a mixture of
**RethinkDB**, **MongoDB** and **PostgreSQL**, indexed using **ElasticSearch**,
and deployed to **AWS**.

**Made.com**, `London, UK`. (Feb 2014 to Apr 2015)

The Enterprise Resource Planning team of this disruptive furniture retailer
uses **Python**, **PostgreSQL** and **OpenERP** to handle the logistics of
manufacturing, importing, retail and returns of furniture sold to customers in
five countries.

When I joined, the two-person team was moribund from years of technical debt
accumulated from development done by off-site consultants. I began to address
this by taking on-site ownership of the codebase, and instituting consistent
source code control. I automated deployment, turning an error-prone five-week
manual process into a one-minute reliable one.

I grew the team to eight, using my own written, voice-chat and face-to-face
pairing exercises, and created a development culture that includes
thorough testing and pre-merge reviews.

As a result the project now has massively improved operational reliability.
Freed from constant bugs and firefighting, the team is now delivering new
business-critical features.

**BATS Global Trading**, `London, UK`. (July 2013 to Feb 2014)

Working on a five person team at this financial exchange to manage the hundreds
of overnight Python batch I/O tasks required to audit and report on the day's
executed trades, representing a sum of money in excess of $50 trillion, daily.
This involves lots of **PostgreSQL**, some **Django**, and the reading and
writing of a variety of data formats, from JSON over HTTP to Excel
spreadsheets.

**Rangespan**, `London, UK`. (July 2011 to June 2013)

Innovative e-commerce startup, bought out by Google after 2 years. I acted as
Python mentor within the team, and as quality, testing, and agile evangelist. I
inculcated a testing culture, created the **continuous integration** process to
deploy powerful features to **Amazon AWS** sustainably, responsively, and
predictably.

I worked especially on the order management **Hypermedia API** using **Django**
and **MySql**. I also created a product search engine for retailers,
backed up by **Elastic Search** and our **MongoDB** catalog of 50 million
heterogeneous products.

**Resolver Systems**, `London, UK`. (Sept 2006 to July 2011)

Hardcore extreme programming startup, producing innovative products for the
financial and scientific sector, and 'Python Anywhere', a
terminal-in-your-browser slash platform-as-a-service.

We wrote 100% of production code using **TDD** and **pairing**, becoming regular
speakers on the "London school" and on "double loop" TDD.

Our native clients were written for a .Net environment using IronPython,
(the .Net implementation of Python) in which we created our own functional test
framework from scratch.

Our online products were written using CPython and JavaScript.

**GIS consulting** `for UK clients`. (3 years from 2003)

    I single-handedly designed and coded
    Habitat Capture, a GUI extension to the ArcMap desktop GIS tool.
    The tool was described by end-users as "*about a billion times better*"
    than the last such tool they commissioned, and the resulting
    atlas compiled by users won top honours at the November
    2008 British Cartographic Society awards, taking both the Avenza Award for
    Electronic Mapping Products and the overall `British Cartographic Award`_.

    At **Ordinance Survey**, I did proof-of-concept SQL processing for
    *MasterMap*, the UK's definitive multi-terabyte national geospatial data
    set.

    For **ESRI UK**, I created an AutoCAD to ArcSDE spatial data importer, to
    improve several cases which the standard ESRI importer handled badly, such
    as using topological operators to correctly create multi-part geometries
    for nested holes and islands.

    At **London Borough of Lambeth**, I created their geodatabase schema;
    designed and started their processes for capturing and loading data;
    created and presented GIS and ESRI training materials to train their staff.

**Schlumberger-Sema**, `aka Convergent Group, Denver, CO`. (5 years from 1998)

Software engineer and GIS consultant on a succession of successful GIS
projects, such as the migration of 250 City of Portland users from disparate
CAD systems to a single ESRI-based platform for city-wide sharing of geospatial
data. This project was subsequently used as a best-practice case study by ESRI.


**Andersen Consulting**, `Newcastle, UK`. (1 year, 1997)

C++ contractor on a 250-developer project to replace the UK's social security
infrastructure. Designed & wrote C++ for the UNIX back end, after
which my 3 month contract was extended to a year on the project's high-intensity
'SWAT' troubleshooting team.


**NetXtra**, `Suffolk, UK`. (18 months, 1996)

Joined this start-up at the company's inception, to build the company from
scratch, with zero capital or external investment, into a business which
nowadays employs over fifty people.


**Graphic Data System**, `Cambridge, UK & Melbourne, Australia.` (2 years, 1995)

Application development in C++ for a multi-platform GIS product, specialized in
map projections, spatial transformations, geometric operations, 2D / 3D
rendering and image data formats.


**Marconi Research Centre**, `Chelmsford, UK` (1 year, 1994)

Research Scientist developing C++ digital signal processing (DSP) algorithms to
analyse radar echoes, for applications such as real-time identification of
non-co-operative aircraft.
