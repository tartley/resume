## Summary

I'm an experienced software developer, a back-end generalist specializing in Python.

I am both an individual contributor, and a technical lead of small, happy teams. I
deliver business value by putting working features into production on a predictable
schedule.

I'm test obsessed, having been reborn mid-career in a hardcore TDD/pairing environment.

I create mentoring relationships and high trust environments, believing in compassion
and integrity. I forge great team spirit and raise morale by building strong, jovial
relationships, taking pride in our humane treatment of one another, and in our raised
expectations of what we become capable of as a group. Great teams create great
individuals, not the other way around.

I've contributed patches to the CPython standard library (in unittest), created
[Colorama](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/colorama),
(the world's
[28th most popular](https://hugovk.github.io/top-pypi-packages/#colorama)
Python library, at 3 million downloads/day). I've presented at international
conferences like PyCon, am a nominated Fellow of the Python Software
Foundation, and a continual open source contributor, eg:

* Some recent
  [in-depth analysis and fixes](https://github.com/getnikola/nikola/issues/3671)
  for static web site generator Nikola.
* [This page of ModernGL docs](https://moderngl.readthedocs.io/en/latest/topics/buffer_format.html),
  which I created from scratch to help me understand a fiddly API concept, using plain
  language but without skirting details.

## Industry Experience

Ubuntu Linux ecosystem and open source (10 years),
GIS and spatial data (10 years),
Finance (5 years),
Online retail, e-commerce, ERP (2 years),
Medical Trials (2 years).

## Favoured Technologies & Techniques

| Recently mostly **Python**, but dabble in other languages as required.
| **Web API** design and implementation using **Django**, **Flask**, etc.
| Relational storage such as **PostgreSQL**, MySQL or Oracle.
| NoSQL such as RethinkDB, & MongoDB, indexed using Elasticsearch.
| Progressive techniques like **TDD**, trunk based development, evidence based estimation.
| **Pairing** and **mentorship** to raise skills & camaraderie within and between teams.
| Hobbyist 2D and 3D graphics using OpenGL.
| C# .Net for GIS and spatial data wrangling (3 years, long ago but fondly remembered).
| C and C++ for GIS, digital signal processing, military radar research (8 years, also long ago).

## Current Role

-------------------- -------------------------------------------------------------------
**Canonical**\       Canonical creates Ubuntu Linux, the world's most popular server OS.
*4 years,*\          I develop the Snap Store, an app store for Linux applications. I
*to present.*        own the specs for several Store aspects, gathering requirements,
                     designing & implementing web APIs, mostly in Python, and production
                     ops. The Store's APIs run at about 5k req/s, allowing authors to
                     publish their applications as snaps, drive various human-visible
                     "app store" applications, and allow reliable, secure updates for
                     hundreds of millions of Ubuntu instances, as well as every other
                     snap-enabled Linux device in the world, including SLA-managed
                     fleets of embedded devices.

## Previous Roles

----------------------- --------------------------------------------------------------------
**IBM Cloud**\          Implementing security groups for IBM Cloud. Mostly using Python,
*2 years*               Golang, calling a hypervisor hosting API to set iptables for
                        dynamic on-instance firewalling. On my own initiative I produced
                        various presentations and training courses, initially for
                        my own team, but later requested across the wider division,
                        which had a transformative effect on code quality,
                        especially on Cloud's massive Python test suite, used and
                        contributed to daily by hundreds of developers.

**Able.ag,**\           Herding small flocks of Python services to provide REST or
**Antidote.me,**\       similar JSON APIs over HTTP. I often work with data scientists
**BATS Trading,**\      on ingestion pipelines to Postgresql or NoSQL datastores like
**Rangespan**\          MongoDB, sometimes indexed using Elasticsearch.\
(acquired by Google)\   I take on roles such as tech lead, agile evangelist, or
*Contracts, 6 years.*   testing guru. For example, at Able.ag I joined to relieve the
                        company's technical founder of architectural, design and
                        mentoring responsibilities.

**Made.com**\           Made was a furniture retailer struggling to model their disruptive
*14 month contract.*    logistics model in customized Enterprise Resource Planning software.
                        I took over a dysfunctional team, moribund from years of technical
                        debt, e.g. nobody could remember when they had last performed the
                        multi-week manual process to release to production. I mentored the
                        existing team, hired more developers, created a one-minute
                        automated CI and deployment pipeline, instituted thorough
                        testing and pre-merge reviews, and together we redesigned and
                        reimplemented their system. This transformed operational
                        reliability, and allowed the team to start delivering new
                        business-critical features to production on a predictable
                        schedule.

**Resolver Systems**\   Hardcore extreme programming startup, producing web and desktop
*5 years.*              software for the financial and scientific sectors.\
                        We paired on all production code, using extremely thorough TDD,
                        all becoming regular conference speakers about TDD, and our
                        specialities, the London school and double-loop style. This
                        was a fascinating and transformative job, you should ask me
                        about it.

**GIS consulting**\     For **Peter Brett Associates** I single-handedly designed and
*3 years.*              coded *Habitat Capture*, a desktop GIS tool written using
                        ArcObjects for ArcMap. End users described the tool as "*about
                        a billion times better*" than the last such tool they had
                        commissioned. The resulting Thames Esturary Coastal Habitat
                        Atlas, compiled using the tool, won top honors at the 2008
                        British Cartographic Society awards.

                        At **Ordinance Survey** I did proof-of-concept SQL processing
                        for *MasterMap*, the UK government's definitive national
                        geospatial data, optimizing spatial queries to run over the
                        multi-terabyte data set in hours instead of weeks.

                        For **ESRI UK** I created an AutoCAD to ArcSDE spatial data
                        importer, to improve several cases which the standard ESRI
                        importer handled badly, such as using topological operators
                        to create correct multi-part geometries for nested holes
                        and islands.
