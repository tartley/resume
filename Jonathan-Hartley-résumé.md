## Summary

I'm an experienced software developer, a back-end generalist specializing in Python.

I am both an individual contributor, and a technical lead of small, happy teams. I
deliver business value by putting working features into production on a predictable
schedule.

I'm test obsessed, having been reborn mid-career in a hardcore TDD/pairing environment.

I create mentoring relationships and high trust environments, believing in compassion
and integrity. I forge great team spirit and raise morale by building strong, jovial
relationships, taking pride in our humane treatment of one another, and in our raised
expectations of what we become capable of as a group. Great teams create great
individuals, not the other way around.

I've contributed patches to the CPython standard library (in unittest), created
[Colorama](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/colorama),
(the world's
[28th most popular](https://hugovk.github.io/top-pypi-packages/#colorama)
Python library, at 3 million downloads/day). I've presented at international
conferences like PyCon, am a nominated Fellow of the Python Software
Foundation, and a continual open source contributor, eg:

* Some recent
  [in-depth analysis and fixes](https://github.com/getnikola/nikola/issues/3671)
  for static web site generator Nikola.
* [This page of ModernGL docs](https://moderngl.readthedocs.io/en/latest/topics/buffer_format.html),
  which I created from scratch to help me understand a fiddly API concept, using plain
  language but without skirting details.

## Experience

Experience in Ubuntu Linux ecosystem and open source (10 years),

## Current Role

-------------------- -------------------------------------------------------------------
**Canonical**\       Canonical creates Ubuntu Linux, the world's most popular server OS.
*4 years,*\          I own the specs for several aspects of the Snap Store, an app store
*to present.*        for Linux applications, for which I gather requirements, design &
                     implement web APIs, and deploy & support production.
                     The Store's APIs run at about 5k req/s, allowing authors to
                     publish their applications as snaps, drive various human-visible
                     "app store" applications, and allow reliable, secure updates for
                     hundreds of millions of Ubuntu instances, as well as every other
                     snap-enabled Linux device in the world, including SLA-managed
                     fleets of embedded devices.

## Previous Roles

----------------------- --------------------------------------------------------------------
**IBM Cloud**\          Implemented security groups for IBM Cloud in Python & Golang,
*2 years*               calling a hypervisor hosting API to set iptables for dynamic
                        on-instance firewalling. On my own initiative I produced
                        various presentations and training courses, initially for
                        my own team, but later repeated for hundreds of developers
                        across the division, especially for my suggested overhauls of
                        Cloud's massive Python test suite.

**Able.ag,**\           Creating REST-like web APIs in Python,
**Antidote.me,**\       I often work with data scientists
**BATS Trading,**\      on ingestion pipelines to RDBMs or NoSQL datastores,
**Rangespan**\          sometimes indexed using Elasticsearch. I act as tech lead,
*Contracts, 6 years.*   or mentor in agile, design, or testing. eg. at Able.ag
                        I relieved the company's technical founder of architectural,
                        design and mentoring responsibilities.

**Made.com**\           Made was a furniture retailer struggling to model their
*14 month contract.*    logistics in customized Enterprise Resource Planning software.
                        I took over a dysfunctional team, moribund from years of technical
                        debt, e.g. nobody could remember when they had last performed the
                        week-long manual process to release to production. I mentored the
                        existing team, hired more developers, created a one-minute
                        automated CI and deployment pipeline, instituted thorough
                        testing and pre-merge reviews, and together we redesigned and
                        reimplemented their system. This transformed operational
                        reliability, and allowed the team to start delivering new
                        business-critical features to production on a predictable
                        schedule.

**Resolver Systems**\   Hardcore extreme programming startup, producing web and desktop
*5 years.*              software for the financial and scientific sectors.\
                        We paired on all production code, using extremely thorough TDD,
                        becoming regular conference speakers about our specialities
                        of "London School" TDD, and the double-loop style. This
                        was a fascinating and transformative job, you should
                        ask me about it.

**GIS consulting**\     For **Peter Brett Associates** I single-handedly designed and
*3 years.*              coded *Habitat Capture*, a desktop GIS tool using
                        ArcObjects for ArcMap. End users described the tool as "*about
                        a billion times better*" than the last such tool they had
                        commissioned. The resulting atlas compiled using the tool
                        won the British Cartographic Society award.

                        At **Ordinance Survey** I did proof-of-concept SQL processing
                        of *MasterMap*, the UK's definitive national geospatial dataset,
                        optimizing spatial queries to run over the terabytes of data
                        in hours instead of weeks.

                        For **ESRI UK** I created a spatial data importer from AutoCAD,
                        using topological operators to correctly create
                        multi-part geometries for nested holes and islands.
