## Summary

I'm an experienced software developer, a back-end generalist specializing in Python.

I enjoy roles as both an individual contributor, and hands-on technical lead of
small, happy teams, where I deliver business value by putting reliable,
maintainable features into production on a predictable schedule.

I believe in mentoring, radically jovial relationships, real talk, taking pride
in our humane treatment of one another, and in our raised expectations of what
we become capable of as a group. Great teams enable the creation of great
individuals, not the other way around.

I consult and mentor in Test-Driven Development (TDD), favoring the "London
School" and "double loop" variants, when appropriate. I was tech reviewer on O'Reilly's
[Test Driven Development with Python](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/test-driven-development-with/9781491958698),
published on testing
[in Python Magazine](https://www.tartley.com/posts/acceptance-testing-net-applications-using-ironpython),
and landed modest CPython patches [in unitttest](https://github.com/python/cpython/commit/1341bb0019868345bab8adff94263c81e1d66eae).

I created
[Colorama](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/colorama),
the world's
[28th most popular](https://hugovk.github.io/top-pypi-packages/#colorama)
Python library,
present at international conferences like PyCon, and am a nominated Fellow of the Python Software
Foundation. I make continual open source contributions, e.g. this recent drive-by
[analysis and fixes](https://github.com/getnikola/nikola/issues/3671)
for static web site generator Nikola, or
[this page of ModernGL docs](https://moderngl.readthedocs.io/en/latest/topics/buffer_format.html),
which I created from scratch to help me understand a fiddly API concept, using plain
language but without skirting details.

## Industries & technologies

Public & private cloud implementation (4 years), Ubuntu Linux ecosystem and
open source (10 years), GIS and spatial data (10 years), Finance (5 years),
Online retail, e-commerce, ERP (2 years), Medical Trials (2 years).

| Recently my projects are mostly **Python**, but I'm delighted to use other languages as required.
| **Web API** design and implementation using **Django**, **Flask**, etc.
| Relational storage such as **PostgreSQL**, MySQL or Oracle.
| NoSQL such as RethinkDB, & MongoDB, indexed using ElasticSearch.
| Progressive techniques like trunk based development, pairing & mob, evidence based estimation.
| Hobbyist 2D and 3D graphics using OpenGL.
| C, C++, C#.Net for GIS, spatial data, radar research (Not current, but fondly remembered.)

## Current Role

-------------- -------------------------------------------------------------------
**Canonical**\ I work on the backend of the
*4 years,*\    [*Snap Store*](https://snapcraft.io/store),
*to present.*  an app store for Linux applications, creating Python web APIs
               to serve 5k req/s, installing and securely updating applications
               for hundreds of millions of Ubuntu & other Linux devices. I
               recently lead a project to migrate data and consolidate logic
               for the company's other types of binary downloadable (e.g.
               container images, "[charms](https://juju.is/about)", etc) into
               the existing snap store services, allowing us to decomission
               other teams' services as their functionality was subsumed, and
               converge behaviors such as publishing, versioned updates, risk
               tracks, etc, to be more consistent across types of downloadable
               artifact, all while honoring high-traffic SLAs & preserving
               compatibility of diverse externally visible APIs for each
               artifact type.

## Previous Roles

------------------ --------------------------------------------------------------------
**IBM Cloud**\     Implemented IBM Cloud's
*2 years*           [*security groups*](https://www.ibm.com/cloud/blog/illustrating-uses-ibm-cloud-security-groups)
                   feature, in Python & GoLang, converting user security group
                   actions into iptables configuration across many instances,
                   to provide dynamic on-instance firewalling. I also produced
                   & presented training courses for the inexperienced team,
                   (e.g had never written GoLang before) which were later
                   requested across the division, especially around Cloud's
                   massive Python test suite, bringing hundreds of developers
                   up to speed on how to contribute *good* tests, dramatically
                   reducing time spent on creating and maintaining tests, while
                   making the tests themselves faster and more reliable.

**Able.ag,**\      Creating REST web APIs in Python,
**Antidote.me,**\  ingesting, transforming and indexing large amounts of data.
**BATS Trading,**\ For example at Rangespan, I integrated with
**Rangespan**\     hundreds of wholesale suppliers to ingest data for 100 million
*Contracts,*\      sellable items, and then routed over a billion sales from
*6 years.*         participating retailers to dynamically selected suppliers.
                   I often act as tech lead, for example, at Able.ag I
                   relieved the company's technical founder of
                   architectural, design and mentoring responsibilities.

**Made.com**\      A furniture retailer, struggling to model their
*14 month*\        logistics in Python Enterprise Resource Planning software.
*contract.*        I took over a dysfunctional team, moribund from years of technical
                   debt. e.g. nobody could remember when they had last performed the
                   week-long manual process to release to production. I mentored the
                   existing team, hired more developers, created a one-minute
                   automated CI and deployment pipeline, and together we radically
                   fixed and improved their legacy systems. This transformed
                   operational reliability, allowing the team to start
                   delivering new business-critical features to production
                   on a predictable schedule.

**Resolver**\      Hardcore eXtreme Programming startup, producing web and desktop
**Systems**\       software in Python and .Net IronPython for financial &
*5 years.*         scientific clients. At one point I re-implemented all of
                   Excel's statistical functions, with improved numerical
                   accuracy. We paired on all code, using extremely thorough
                   TDD, becoming regular conference speakers on the topics.

**GIS**\           For **Peter Brett Associates** I single-handedly designed and
**consulting**\    coded *Habitat Capture*, a desktop GIS tool in .Net using
*3 years.*         ArcObjects for ArcMap. End users described it as "*about
                   a billion times better*" than their last commisioned tool.
                   The resulting dataset won that year's British
                   Cartographic Society award.

                   At **Ordinance Survey** I did proof-of-concept SQL processing
                   of *MasterMap*, the UK's definitive national geospatial dataset,
                   optimizing spatial SQL queries over terabyte datasets to run
                   in hours instead of weeks.

                   For **ESRI UK** I created a .Net spatial data importer
                   from AutoCAD, using topological operators to correctly
                   create multi-part geometries for nested holes and
                   islands.
